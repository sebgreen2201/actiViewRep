# actiViewRep
This project consists of a runner file and a test file. 
The runner file consists of three methods one to calculate the VaR for a single trade, one which returns a list of the sum of each group of trades
in a portfolio and one which uses this method to return the VaR for the portfolio.
There is also a test class with three tests, two tests for the single trade calculation with two different data sets and a test for the portfolio VaR.
The dependencies needed are in the pom.xml file and consists of the junit depencies for testing. 
Was created as a maven project in eclipse and could be run by importing into eclipse as an existing maven project.
